# Quiz API App

## API Choice
This app uses the **Open Trivia Database (OpenTDB) API** to fetch trivia questions.  
I chose this API because it provides a large, structured dataset of questions with multiple categories, difficulty levels, and question types.  

## Why this API is relevant
A trivia app is engaging and educational. By fetching live data from an API, users can:
- Play quizzes on a variety of topics.
- Improve general knowledge.
- Experience dynamic content that updates automatically without app updates.

The app demonstrates how mobile applications can interact with web APIs using **Retrofit** and **OkHttp**, showing real-world skills in networking and JSON handling.
